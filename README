=== Description ===
This project creates a comment area for your website which uses the power of twitter to gather comments and drive extra traffic.

Users comment through a text field which directs them to post a specially formatted (human-readable) post on twitter. The post has a bit.ly link back to the page which was being commented. The posts are displayed under the comments in the order they were made with a link to view in Twitter.

Once a post is made, all the commenters followers will see their thoughts on your page or website and potentially click on the bit.ly link to visit your website.
